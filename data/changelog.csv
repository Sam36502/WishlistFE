Minor Feature Update,Version 1.2,"26th of May 2022. Added a couple convenience features, and no, I haven't added image capability yet; that brings a lot of technical challenges with it.","'Keep me logged in' should now actually work, at least up to a month.;Item status is now shown on the list page instead of the description."
Security Update!,Version 1.1,"21st of May 2022. I've managed to actually get around to updating this. Sadly, I don't have any really exciting new features to report, but the security between the website and API has been improved significantly.","Uses JWT instead of (incorrect) Oauth2 for API authentication;SSL Certs are dynamically mapped so it won't just stop working once they expire;Code was slightly cleaned up everywhere"
First Full Release!,Version 1.0,"Today, the 21st of November 2021, I've finally gotten the whole app to a point where I'm happy enough with how finished it is. Below is a list of all the features available in the first version. Thank you for your patience and please enjoy:","Creating user accounts and wishlists;Adding/deleting items from your wishlist;Reserving other users' items for purchase and;Changing your password"
